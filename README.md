#### Problem solved
AfterFlight is the best solution to bring you to your final destination after travelling by plane. 
You can find someone that wants to pick you up from the airport and bring you to your final destination by car for a good price.
Or vica versa, you can pick someone up from the airport near your house and bring that person to their final destination, and receive some money.
The chat/post function makes it possible to discuss and decide the price together, and also give each other personal information (like phone number) or your flight number.

#### Data sets and data sources
AfterFlight needs a database for accounts(which includes posts), this can be done with the parse(.com) API.

#### Application parts
The Application parts are defined above (see features). After that someone accepted a service (to give or get) a new chat will be opened automatically with associated person.

#### Platform & APIs
AfterFlight will be created in the Android Studio platform with java and xml, and will be combined with the parse API.

#### Potential problems & possibilities to overcome these
Implementing a chat function in the application could make it complex for me. If the chat function does not work, then I have to find another way to bring the traveler and car driver to each other. A simple solution could be that they get each others e-mail address/phone number directly after accepting a post.

#### Similar applications
Uber: AfterFlight will be planned version of Uber, that means that you make a reservation for another day, and the price will be decided by the client and customer.
